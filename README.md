#This project focuses on building a machine learning regression model using a Random Forest Regressorto predict numerical values based on input features. 
The goal is to explore the power of ensemble learning techniques in regression tasks and assess model performance using evaluation metrics.

#🧠 Objectives
Load and preprocess the dataset
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train a Random Forest Regressor
Make predictions on test data
Evaluate the model’s performance
Draw conclusions and explore future improvements

#🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook or Python script

#✅ Conclusion
The Random Forest Regressor effectively learned from the dataset and provided reliable predictions. The project serves as a solid foundation for further
enhancements like feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring other regression models.
